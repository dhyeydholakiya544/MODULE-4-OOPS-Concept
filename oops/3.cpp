What is the difference between OOP and POP?

Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP):

Focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.
Organizes code into procedures or functions that operate on data.
Data is shared among procedures, and each procedure modifies the data as needed.
Emphasizes step-by-step processing and sequential execution.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Focuses on objects and classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
Organizes code into objects that interact with each other.
Data is encapsulated within objects, and objects communicate with each other through methods.
Emphasizes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.
