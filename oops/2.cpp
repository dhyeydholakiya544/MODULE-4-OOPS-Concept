2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. OOP provides a way to organize and structure code in a modular, reusable, and maintainable manner.

Here are the key OOP concepts:

Classes: Blueprints or templates that define the properties 
and behavior of an object.

Objects: Instances of classes, which have their own set of 
attributes (data) and methods (functions).

Inheritance: A mechanism that allows one class to inherit the 
properties and behavior of another class.

Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on multiple forms, 
depending on the context.

Encapsulation: The idea of bundling data and methods that operate
 on that data within a single unit (a class).

Abstraction: The concept of showing only the necessary 
information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details.

Composition: The process of creating objects from other objects or 
collections of objects.
